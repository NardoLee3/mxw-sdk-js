Signing
-------

:sup:`prototype` . sign ( transaction ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<string>`
    Signs *transaction* and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to
    the signed transaction as a :ref:`hex string <hexstring>`.

    In general, the `sendTransaction`_ method is preferred to ``sign``, as it can automatically
    populate values asynchronously.

Name Service
------------

:sup:`prototype` . createAlias ( name, appFee ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sign alias creation transaction and send it to network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Response <transaction-receipt>`. Alias application approval is required by authority.


    Note: The alias should not contains any spaces, special characters or any sensitive words.
    The application fee should be set according to the configured value.

-----

Cryptographic Functions
-----------------------

:sup:`prototype` . computeSharedSecret ( otherPublicKey ) |nbsp| `=> string`
    Compute the *shared secret* by using other wallet's public key and returns as a :ref:`hex string <hexstring>`.
    In general, the shared secret should not directly uses as encryption key. Instead of derive it using :ref:`pbkdf2 <pbkdf2>`.

-----

Blockchain Operations
---------------------

These operations require the wallet have a provider attached to it.

:sup:`prototype` . getBalance ( ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<BigNumber>`
    Returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the balance (as a :ref:`BigNumber <bignumber>`,
    in **cin**) of the wallet. Be aware of the number of decimals for *cin* is 18.
    The balance can be convert to a human readable format by :ref:`formatMxw <formatMxw>`, versa :ref:`parseMxw <parseMxw>`.

:sup:`prototype` . transfer ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>`, value ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sends the *transfer transaction* to the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.

    The :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` can be set to recipient alias or wallet address. The ``value`` is the number of *cin*
    (as a :ref:`BigNumber <bignumber>`) that transfers to recipient. Be aware of the number of decimals for *cin*
    is 18.

:sup:`prototype` . getTransactionCount ( ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<BigNumber>`
    Returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resovles to the number of transactions
    this account has ever sent (as a :ref:`BigNumber <bignumber>`).

.. _sendTransaction:

:sup:`prototype` . sendTransaction ( transaction ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionResponse>`
    Sends the *transaction* (see :ref:`Transaction Requests <transaction-request>`) to
    the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Response <transaction-receipt>`. Any properties that are not
    provided will be populated from the network.

.. code-block:: javascript

    let wallet = new mxw.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

    wallet.getBalance().then((balance) => {
        console.log(balance);
    });

    wallet.getTransactionCount().then((nonce) => {
        console.log(nonce);
    });


.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: *transfer mxw*

    // We require a provider to send transactions

    let to = "mxw1j4yh2gfumy8d327n0uvztg9075fjzd59vxf9ae";
    // ... or supports Alias names
    // to: "jeansoon",

    let amount = mxw.utils.parseMxw("1.0");
    // We must pass in the amount as cin (1 mxw = 1e18 cin), so we
    // use this convenience function to convert mxw to cin.

    return wallet.transfer(to, amount).then((receipt) => {
        console.log(receipt);
        // Should check the transaction status = 1 means successfully added into block
    });

Encrypted JSON Wallets
----------------------

Many systems store private keys as encrypted JSON wallets, in various formats. There are several
formats and algorithms that are used, all of which are supported to be read.
Only the secure scrypt variation can be generated.

See :ref:`Wallet.fromEncryptedJson <fromEncryptedJson>` for creating a
Wallet instance from a JSON wallet.

:sup:`prototype` . encrypt ( password [ , options [ , progressCallback ] ] ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<string>`
    Encrypts the wallet as an encrypted JSON wallet, with the *password*.

    All options are optional. The valid options are:

        - **salt** --- the salt to use for scrypt
        - **iv** --- the initialization vecotr to use for aes-ctr-128
        - **uuid** --- the UUID to use for the wallet
        - **scrypt** --- the scrypt parameters to use (N, r and p)
        - **entropy** --- the mnemonic entropy of this wallet; generally you should **not** specify this
        - **mnemonic** --- the mnemonic phrase of this wallet; generally you should **not** specify this
        - **path** --- the mnemonic path of this wallet; generally you should **not** specify this

    If the *progressCallback* is specified, it will be called periodically during
    encryption with a value between 0 and 1, inclusive indicating the progress.


.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: *encrypt a wallet as an encrypted JSON wallet*

    let password = "any strong password";

    function callback(progress) {
        console.log("Encrypting: " + parseInt(progress * 100) + "% complete");
    }

    return wallet.encrypt(password, callback).then((json) => {
        console.log(json);
    });

Signer API
==========

The Signer API is an abstract class which makes it easy to extend and add new signers,
that can be used by this library and extension libraries. The :ref:`Wallet <wallet>`
extends the Signer API.

To implement a Signer, inherit the abstract class *mxw.types.Signer* and implement
the following properties:

:sup:`object` . provider
    A :ref:`Provider <api-provider>` that is connected to the network. This is optional, however,
    without a *provider*, **only** *write-only* operations should be expected to work.

:sup:`object` . getAddress ( ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<Address>`
    Returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the account address.

:sup:`object` . signMessage ( message ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<hex>`
    Returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the :ref:`Flat-Format Signature <signature>`
    for the *message*.

    If *message* is a string, it is converted to UTF-8 bytes, otherwise it is
    preserved as a binary representation of the :ref:`Arrayish <arrayish>` data.

:sup:`object` . sign ( transaction ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<hex>`
    Returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the *signed* transaction that ready to send to the network.

:sup:`object` . sendTransaction ( transaction ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionResponse>`
    Sends the *transaction* (see :ref:`Transaction Requests <transaction-request>`) to
    the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Response <transaction-receipt>`. Any properties that are not
    provided will be populated from the network.
